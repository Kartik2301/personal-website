    <p>Hey there, my name is Kartik Nema ({{ age }}), currently working as a Software Developer Intern at <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/index.html">Cisco</a>. I am in the 8th and final semester of the B.Tech program offered by <a href="https://www.iiita.ac.in/">IIIT Allahabad</a>. The subject of my major is Information Technology, I'll be graduating in a period of 5-6 months.<br><br>Technology has always fascinated me, The idea that you can have the entire world at your fingertips, the idea that one can Connect with someone else at the other end of the world, in a few basic steps, the idea that one can order whatever they need, be it groceries, clothes, medicines and a lot more by just a few button clicks, all of this is is truly incredible. Advances in technology, specially with regards to Medical, banking and collaboration fields, have helped the world a great bit in dealing with the Covid-19 Pandemic thus far, and as our fight goes on technology will play an even bigger part in the future.  <br><br>
    It was this fascination, which led me to opting for the Information Technology branch, my goal throughout has been to design technologies which helps the society, which help to solve problems which people might be facing, it also involves making technology more accessible. In this pursuit, I have tried to train myself accordingly. I started by learning the C and C++ programming languages, and started coding, some time later I got introduced to the world of development thanks to the seniors of my college. As time followed, I learned more about different programming languages, different tech frameworks, and simultaneously college courses like DSA, DBMS, OOM, OS gave me a better understanding of this enormous field of IT. This curosity, has always pushed me to learn more, become better, and more importantly not stop.<br><br>
    As things stand, I have experiene with Android Development technologies (Java/Kotlin/XML, Flutter), Web Development technologies (NodeJS, Flask, Django), Multiple programming langugages (C,C++,Java,Python), Databases (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite), Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning Technologies etc. I intend to keep learning, and keep improving with regard to the things I already know. Some of the projects that I have made thus far, are available on Home Page, further a link is also available to the technologial articles I have written.<br><br>
    In case you would like to reach out to me, then you will find the handles mentioned at the top handy. You can also contact me at <b><i>knem7554@gmail.com</i></b> <br>Thanks for your time, and have a nice day.</p>
